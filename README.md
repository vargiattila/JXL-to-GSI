# JXL-to-GSI
Converts Trimble JobXML (.jxl extension) file to Leica GSI file format
During my daily work, using a Trimble total station (with Trimble Acces field software) and the GeoEasy (network adjustment tool), I encountered several minor problems. First of all, the main problem arose with Trimble Acces export module. Any of Trimble Acces export formats managed by Geoeasy cannot handle multi-round measurements, so pre-processing is required, when the results of the different rounds are averaged. The entire data structure is only contained in Trimble .job or JobXML, but GeoEasy does not manage it.
In SDR33 file format (managed by GeoEasy), the multi-round onservations are not exported as averaged measurements and only the raw distances (with applied prism constant) are written to the result file, temperature and atmospheric corrections are not taken into account, so serious differences can be observed in the case of large distances. 
The exports of other file formats managed by GeoEasy are not possible with Trimble Acces. Because there is no option to export into GSI file format, and it seemed to me the easiest way to code, I created this conversation tool, realized in Python. This script collects the relevant data from the TrimbleJobXML(.jxl) file, applies the corrections affecting the distances, averages the measurements of the different rounds, and finally exports them out in accordance with the GSI data structure into a file, which is already managed by GeoEasy.
