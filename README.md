# JXL-to-GSI
Converts Trimble JobXML (.jxl extension) file to Leica GSI file format
During my daily work, using a Trimble total station (with Trimble Acces field software) and the GeoEasy (network adjustment tool), I encountered several minor problems. First of all, GeoEasy cannot handle multi-round measurements, so pre-processing is required, when the results of the different rounds are averaged. The following problem arose with Trimble's export module. The entire data structure is only contained in Trimble JobXML, but GeoEasy does not manage it. In the export of SDR33 file format (managed by GeoEasy), only the raw distances (with applied prism constant) are exported to the result file, temperature and atmospheric corrections are not taken into account, so serious differences can be observed in the case of large distances. Because there is no option to export into GSI file format, and it seemed to me the easiest way to code, I created this conversation tool, realized in Python. This script collects the relevant data from the TrimbleJobXML(.jxl) file, applies the corrections affecting the distances, averages the measurements of the different rounds, and finally exports them out in accordance with the GSI data structure into a file, which is already managed by GeoEasy.
